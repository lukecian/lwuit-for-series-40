= LWUIT for Series 40 Developer Documentation =

== Getting started ==

=== Part 1 ===
This section contains step-by-step instructions on how to install the needed development tools, configure them, and develop a simple LWUIT application for Series 40 using the !NetBeans or Eclipse IDE and the Nokia SDK.

* [wiki:GettingStartedWithLwuit Getting started with LWUIT using Netbeans]
* [wiki:GettingStartedWithLwuitUsingEclipse Getting started with LWUIT using Eclipse]

=== Part 2 ===
In this section we continue with the project we started in Part 1 by adding more LWUIT features such as Layout, List, !TextField, Button, and mapping Commands to softkeys. This section also explains how to use the JSR-75 PIM API in this context.

* [wiki:CreatingContactBookDemo Creating a simple contact book demo]

=== Part 3 ===
In this section we show how to create a simple graphical user interface with Resource Editor, and how to add the design into an application project.

The LWUIT Resource Editor is a fairly new stand-alone program that enables creating user interfaces in a drag-and-drop manner. Also custom themes can be easily designed. We are planning to further improve the functionality of this tool.

* [wiki:NokiaCustomItemsInRE Nokia Additions to ResourceEditor]

=== Part 4 ===
In this section we describe how you can import and build example applications.

== Developing with LWUIT for Series 40 ==

This section describes the most notable differences that have been made for the LWUIT for Series 40 port. Most changes are transparent to developers so it is possible to use the familiar LWUIT APIs also in Series 40.
