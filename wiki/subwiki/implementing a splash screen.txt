= Implementing a Splash Screen =

It is common to display a splash screen on application startup to promote your brand and to indicate the user that the application is loading. LWUIT doesn't offer a specialized splash screen component, but it is easy to implement by creating and displaying a Form in the beginning of the MIDlet startApp method before constructing the rest of the application. To avoid extra wait times the main UI should be constructed in the background while the splash screen is being displayed.

{{{#!java 
public void startApp() {
    Display.init(this); // initialize LWUIT Display

    // SplashView is a Form that displays the splash screen
    splashView = new SplashView(this);
    splashView.show();

    // Start initializing the main view in the background
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    mainView = new MainView(this); // MainView extends Form

    long difference = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
    try {
        // Show splash view for at least a second
        Thread.sleep(Math.max(0, 1000 - difference));
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    }

    mainView.show();
}
}}}
