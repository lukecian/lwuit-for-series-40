= Automatic Localization =

A new feature called "automatic localization" has been introduced in the v0.8.3 release. If you want to create a localization and want it to be automatically loaded based on device locale then you can use this convention to achieve that.

== The Convention ==
To have LWUIT automatically load you localization you must create a '''locale.res''' Resourcefile and put it to the "locale" named folder inside your app. When you create the localization in !ResourceEditor give it a name "locale". When LWUIT is initialized it will try to load this file automatically and queries device locale and tries to set the current localization based on that.[[BR]][[BR]]

Here's how the project structure looks like when locale.res is added with the correct locale folder.
