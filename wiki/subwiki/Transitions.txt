= Transitions =
Transitions use the animation framework. The following animations between views are supported:

 * Sliding from or to top/bottom, left/right.
 * Fade in/out.
 * Timeline, which uses an image as an alpha mask between the start and the end states of the transition.
 * Simultaneous slide & fade.
 * Pulsate (available for dialogs only)
