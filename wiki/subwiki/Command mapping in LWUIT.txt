= Command mapping in LWUIT =
== Primary action ==
The most important function of each view can be set with the defaultcommand. There is a slight difference in what that function should be in non-touch compared to touch UIs; in non-touch the action is usually ‘Select’ for the focused item rather than a view-specific action, whereas for touch UIs it can be pretty much anything.

== Options menu: secondary actions ==
The Options menu contains common actions for each view. Any commands that can be accessed directly from the content area should not be repeated in the menu.

== Context menu: item-specific actions ==
The Context menu is considered to be a shortcut to item-specific actions. The same actions should be accessible also by other means; typically from the next hierarchy level down (that is, the  item detail view).
