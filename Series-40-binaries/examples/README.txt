This folder contains example applications. The projects are structured so that there is a master project that
has many sub-projects for different platforms. Basically all the app logic is in the master project and inside the sub-
project is all the platform spesific code. For S40 the relevant code is in the master and in the MIDP sub-project.

This kind of project structure is also generated by the ResourceEditor.
