LWUIT for Series 40 Technology Preview
##############################################

This folder contains the prebuilt binaryfiles for different sdks.
If you are only compiling your application for spesific sdks you should
use the binaries for that sdk.

If you want to support all the s40 devices then you need to compile with 
the latest sdk possible. LWUIT for Series 40 provides runtime compatability
to older devices so compiling with sdk 2.0 allows you to run the application
with devices before sdk 2.0.

Binaries for older SDKs will only contain APIs that are supported by that SDK.
So Series 40 6th ed. SDK won't contain APIs for gestures and TextEditor. Similarly
binaries for SDK 1.1 won't contain SDK 2.0 spesific APIs.

##############################################

Currently there are binaries for:
* Series 40 6th Edition
* SDK 1.1 (works on 1.0 also)
* SDK 2.0
