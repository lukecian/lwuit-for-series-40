<h2>Technical Issues</h2>

<a name="Q7">
<h3>Q: I'm experiencing a performance problem with LWUIT, what should I do?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    See if the performance problem exists in the LWUIT Demo, LWUIT-Makeover etc. 
    If the use case isn't represented there try to build a use case which represents
    the performance issue and investigate.<br/>
    Both the developer guide and the blog cover the issue of optimizing performance and
    memory footprint.
</p> 

<a name="Q8">
<h3>Q: I'm getting out of memory errors in LWUIT/LWUIT is consuming allot of memory in my memory monitor</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Check that your application doesn't hold onto pointers for components, since a component references its 
    parent component holding onto a single button can keep an entire form with all its content in memory... 
    LWUIT allocates and discards frequently to allow for a small memory footprint, this causes the graph of
    free memory to fluctuate but the alternative of caching would be worse for highly constrained devices.
    Check out the LWUIT blog for more information on the subject of 
    <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/06/memory-leaks-in-lwuit-and-tracking.html">tracking and identifying memory issues</a>.
</p> 

<a name="Q9">
<h3>Q: Why my list/text area won't scroll/jumps around?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    You need to disable the scrolling for the form using myForm.setScrollable(false) and you
    should place the list in a center of a border layout. 
    For deeper understanding of why this is required read the next question about scrolling.
</p> 

<a name="Q10">
<h3>Q: How can I make scrolling more elaborate? Does LWUIT only support scrolling based on focus? 
Why isn't scrolling of an element larger than screen size supported?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    LWUIT features an open interface for scrolling allowing any component to define the way
    in which it wishes to scroll. This interface is used by the TextArea and List components
    to implement their internal scroll functionality.<br />
    LWUIT doesn't scroll containers, instead it provides focus traversal which causes 
    scrolling to the focused component. This is a very powerful approach (and very common
    on small devices) since it allows easy interaction, however in some circumstances (mostly
    viewers) LWUIT focus based scrolling doesn't behave as expected. Since the scrolling architecutre
    is exposed, developers can extend container and override the scrolling/key handling to behave 
    as expected.<br />
    Scrolling a single component which is larger than the screen isn't supported by LWUIT containers by 
    default (this is a very difficult edge case for focus based scrolling). 
    Scrolling multiple smaller components is not a problem.<br />
    Community member <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?messageID=300994">Elliot Long</a>
    contributed his own solution to "visual scrolling" which allows scrolling without focus. 
    The LWUIT blog covers simple image scrolling and explains the details
    <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/07/motion-madness-physics-gone-wild.html">here</a>.
</p> 

<a name="Q11">
<h3>Q: How do I change the appearance of the list? Remove the numbers from the side etc? Can I nest containers in the list?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    List is designed for a very large number of element and fast traversal, you can use
    its cell renderer facility to customize it any way you want as explained 
    <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/07/lwuit-list-renderer-by-chen-fishbein.html">here</a>.
    How the list can scale and grow is explained 
    <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/07/lwuit-list-renderer-by-chen-fishbein.html">here</a> and 
    additionally <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/06/lightweight-text-input-in-lwuit.html">here</a>. 
</p> 

<a name="Q12">
<h3>Q: My application freeses or stalls how do I fix this?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    99% of the problems of this type are related to EDT violations. The EDT is the Event Dispatch
    Thread which broadcasts all the events in LWUIT, it is also responsible for drawing all elements
    on the screen. <br>
    The EDT thread is responsible for drawing all screen elements, if it is blocked by a long running 
    operation elements won't update and key/pointer events won't be received. The solution is to use
    threads for such long running tasks, however interaction with LWUIT can only be performed on the 
    EDT. To return into the EDT you can use Display.callSerially/callSeriallyAndWait, a different option
    is to use <a href="http://lwuit.blogspot.com/2008/05/invokeandblock-foxtrot-inspired.html">invokeAndBlock</a>.
</p> 

<a name="Q13">
<h3>Q: I'm not opening any threads but getting some problems?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    A typical application always uses at least two threads, lifecycle and the EDT. The lifecycle thread
    is the callback thread used for the application, e.g. in MIDP the startApp method is invoked from the
    MIDP thread which is different from the EDT.
</p> 

<a name="Q14">
<h3>Q: Can nothing work from a separate thread?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    There are no guarantees, repaint() should generally work from every thread and show() should as well.
</p> 

<a name="Q15">
<h3>Q: How do I reposition/resize a dialog?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Use a Dialog instance and a version of show which accepts 4 integer values to position the dialog.
    You can use the set the default dialog position to simplify dialog positioning.
</p> 

<a name="Q16">
<h3>Q: How do I show Video?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Use MMAPI to create a Player object which you can submit to the MediaComponent class.
</p> 

<a name="Q17">
<h3>Q: How do I show SVG/3D?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Use the M3G API or the SVGImage API to place such elements in the UI.
</p> 

<a name="Q18">
<h3>Q: Can I create my own components?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Everything in LWUIT is fully extensible, you can derive from any component and extend it. It 
    is demonstrated in the developer guide and extensively in the blog.
</p> 

<a name="Q19">
<h3>Q: I'm trying to display an animated gif and thats not working?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Animated gifs can be shown in MIDP using the MMAPI and MediaComponent (see the MMAPI question). LWUIT has
    special support for StaticAnimation which is a LWUIT specific format very similar to the animated gif.
    Both the resource editor and the ant task accept animated GIF files to create static animations.
</p> 

<a name="Q22">
<h3>Q: I'm having problems on the BlackBerry?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    The BlackBerry VM has some issues with linking to classes that aren't on the device, a BlackBerry specific 
    version built with the BlackBerry VM is necessary. See the <a href="https://lwuit-incubator.dev.java.net/">LWUIT-incubator</a> 
    project for a community built port for the BlackBerry.
</p> 

<a name="Q23">
<h3>Q: I'm having issues on a Windows Mobile device?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Windows mobile VM's vary significantly in their quality if the VM is giving you
    problems try <a href="http://phoneme.dev.java.net/">the Phone ME</a> open source VM 
    <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/terrencebarr/archive/2008/04/alive_and_kicki.html">port for Windows mobile devices</a>.
</p> 


<h2>Resources</h2>
<a name="Q20">
<h3>Q: How do I create resource (.res) files?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Use the LWUIT Designer (formerly the resource editor) or Ant task, both are 
    covered in the developer guide. 
</p> 

<a name="Q21">
<h3>Q: What is the difference between the LWUIT Designer (Resource Editor) and the Ant task?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    The difference is mainly in the use case, the ant tool is designed mostly for developer related
    resources (locales, application images etc..). The LWUIT Designer is desgined for use by graphics
    desginers.
</p> 

<a name="Q21">
<h3>Q: Can I Export Resource Files to Ant XML?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    No, allot of the information no longer exists within the resource file such as 
    the actual name of the bitmap fonts etc.<br/>
    However, we are considering a future modification to the resource file format
    that will allow such functionality.
</p> 

<a name="Q21">
<h3>Q: What is compatibility mode?</h3>
</a>
<p>
    Compatibility mode allows LWUIT styles to function in a way similar to the
    first revisions of LWUIT where one style mapped to one component instance.
    Newer versions of LWUIT allow 2 or more styles per component and deprecate
    the usage of the selection attributes (bgSelectionColor, fgSelectionColor) in
    favor of a separate style to indicate selection state.<br/>
    Existing code that manipulates styles using the getStyle()/setStyle() methods
    might not function in the same way. For further details please read:
