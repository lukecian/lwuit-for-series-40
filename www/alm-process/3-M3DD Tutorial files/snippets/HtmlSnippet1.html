Read the document to understand the application you are trying to build.</li><li>Next, get the skeleton project, <a href="https://lwuit.dev.java.net/files/documents/8797/124271/ThemeStore.zip">ThemeStore.zip</a>. Unzip the file and open the project in NetBeans. Adjust the path to LWUIT and make sure your emulator is set up correctly. Once everything is in place, you will be able to build and run the project, although it won't do much.</li></ol><p><br />A complete, running solution to the ThemeStore exercise is available, <a href="https://lwuit.dev.java.net/files/documents/8797/124272/ThemeStore-solution.zip">ThemeStore-solution.zip</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
