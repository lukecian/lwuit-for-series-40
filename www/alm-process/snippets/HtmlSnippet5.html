Writing appealing cross device applications today in Java ME is challenging.    
Due to implementation differences in fonts, layout, menus, etc.      
the same application may look and behave very differently on different devices.     
In addition much of the advanced UI functionality is not accessible in 
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr037/javax/microedition/lcdui/package-frame.html">LCDUI</a>       
and requires the developer to write very low level &quot;paint&quot; type code.      
The Lightweight UI Toolkit was developed to address these issues.     
The Lightweight UI Toolkit makes it very easy to create compelling UI's that     
will look and behave the same on all devices using a programming paradigm similar to Swing.     
This Toolkit is able to run on CLDC1.1 MIDP2.0/CDC PBP/SE. <br /><br />
