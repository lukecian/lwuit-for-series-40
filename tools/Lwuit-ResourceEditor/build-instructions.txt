Introduction

ResourceEditor is built with maven because it has a lot of third party dependencies it's easier to use maven than bundle
every jar file to the repository.

Step 0.
Install maven and ant. Instructions can be found from http://maven.apache.org and
http://ant.apache.org

Step 1.
Run build-resourceeditor.bat 

Step 2.

run resoureeditor from target folder with "java -jar Lwuit-ResourceEditor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"

notice that the "lib" folder contains all the jar-files resourceeditor uses so the folder
must be in the same folder as the jar file
